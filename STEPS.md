✅ Step 1: Start the Lab and Access the AWS Console
At the top of your lab page, click Start Lab.

Wait for the lab environment to be ready (the circle next to the AWS link will turn green).

Click the AWS link in the top-left corner to open the AWS Management Console in a new tab.

Allow pop-ups if your browser blocks it.

Arrange your browser so the Console and Lab instructions are side by side.

Let me know once you’ve done this, and we’ll move to Task 1: Explore the users and groups, and inspect policies.

Awesome! 👏 Now let’s move on to the next part.

✅ Task 1: Explore the users and groups, and inspect policies
1. Check your Region
Look at the upper-right corner of the AWS Console. Note the Region (e.g., N. Virginia). You'll need it later.

2. Explore IAM Users
From the Services menu, find and click IAM (under Security, Identity, & Compliance).

In the left sidebar, click Users.

Click on user-1.

On the summary page:

Check the Permissions tab → Should show No permissions.

Go to the Groups tab → user-1 is not in any groups.

Go to the Security credentials tab → Confirm the user has a Console password assigned.

3. Explore IAM Groups
In the left sidebar, click User groups.

Click EC2-Support group.

Go to the Permissions tab.

You’ll see AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess policy attached.

Click the policy name → Click the JSON tab → Review the structure:

"Effect": "Allow"

"Action": "ec2:Describe*" and other similar actions

"Resource": "*"

Go back to User groups, and now:

Click S3-Support → Permissions tab → Review AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess → Click into it → JSON tab.

Click EC2-Admin group → Permissions tab → Review inline policy called EC2-Admin-Policy → JSON tab → Allows Start, Stop, Describe.

Once you’ve explored all 3 groups and policies, let me know — then we’ll move on to Task 2: Add users to groups.

Perfect, you’re cruising through this! 🚀

✅ Task 2: Add users to groups
Let’s assign the users to the correct groups based on their intended responsibilities.

1. Add user-1 to EC2-Admin group
Go to IAM → Users → Click user-1.

In the Groups tab, click Add user to groups.

Select EC2-Admin, then click Add to groups.

2. Add user-2 to EC2-Support group
Click on user-2 → Groups tab → Add user to groups → Select EC2-Support → Click Add to groups.

3. Add user-3 to S3-Support group
Same steps: user-3 → Groups → Add to groups → Select S3-Support → Add.

✅ After doing this, each user will inherit the permissions from their group — no need to assign policies directly to the users.

Let me know once all three users are added to the correct groups, and we’ll test their permissions in Task 3: Sign in as IAM users.

Awesome, you're knocking this out like a pro! ✅

🧪 Task 3: Sign in and test user permissions
Now we’ll verify the permissions by signing in as each user using the IAM sign-in URL.

Task 3.1: Get the IAM sign-in URL
In the IAM Dashboard, locate the Sign-in URL for IAM users (top section).

It should look like this:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://[your_account_id].signin.aws.amazon.com/console
Copy that URL to a text editor or keep it handy.

Task 3.2: Test user-1 permissions (EC2 Admin)
Open an incognito/private browser window.

Paste the sign-in URL, and log in with:

Username: user-1

Password: Lab-Password1

✅ What to do as user-1:

Go to EC2 → You should be able to:

View EC2 instances

Stop or Start an instance
(user-1 is in the EC2-Admin group, so full EC2 control applies)

Go to S3 → You should get a permissions error (no access).

✅ Once tested, sign out.

Task 3.3: Test user-2 permissions (EC2 Support)
Sign in using:

Username: user-2

Password: Lab-Password2

✅ What to do as user-2:

Go to EC2 → You should be able to view instances but not stop/start them.

Try S3 → You should get a permissions error.

✅ Sign out after testing.

Task 3.4: Test user-3 permissions (S3 Support)
Sign in with:

Username: user-3

Password: Lab-Password3

✅ What to do as user-3:

Go to S3 → You should be able to browse buckets and view contents.

Try EC2 → You should get a permissions error.

Let me know once you’ve tested all 3 users — then we’ll wrap up and submit your work 💪

🔥 Excellent work! You've completed all the tasks in the "Exploring AWS IAM" lab:

✅ Lab Summary
You've successfully:

Created 3 IAM users with unique credentials.

Organized users into groups and attached appropriate IAM policies.

Tested access permissions by signing in as each user to confirm that:

user-1 (EC2-Admin): Full EC2 access.

user-2 (EC2-Support): Read-only EC2 access.

user-3 (S3-Support): Read-only S3 access.

🧠 What You’ve Learned
IAM users vs groups

Attaching AWS managed policies

Least privilege principle

Testing permissions via IAM login portal
